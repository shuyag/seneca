                                <p>On March 29, 2011, The Seneca teamed up with Delta Gamma and The Harvard College Women's Center to host a campus-wide Social Spaces Conversation. The objective of the event was to provide an open forum for discussing the current state of our campus's social space, specifically after the addition of female sororities and social clubs. We had a tremendous turn-out, with more than one hundred people in attendance, including members of a variety of male and female social organizations, as well as students who do not belong to social organizations. Attendees broke into smaller discussion groups led by members of The Seneca and Delta Gamma.  The event spurred meaningful conversations and suggestions for action to improve social life at Harvard.</p>

                                <p>The Red Party was founded in April of 1999 and has been held at a club in Boston every spring since then. As the first Harvard party open to all undergraduates, The Red Party was a revolutionary idea that has inspired various other campus-wide parties. Each year, The Seneca launches an extensive publicity campaign (including the first use of Facebook profile pictures to advertise an event, which turned into the first Facebook advertisement) in order to ensure that all undergraduates on campus are invited and welcomed to the party. The party was created to establish a comfortable social space for the Harvard community in which all students can interact on equal terms, and The Red Party remains a much-anticipated night each year.</p>

                                <p>Inspired by the FDA's approval of GARDASIL, a new vaccine that protects women against 4 strains of Human Papillomavirus (HPV), The Seneca spearheaded an information-based campaign in partnership with 14 other groups on campus to promote awareness of HPV and encourage women to make informed decisions about whether or not to get the vaccine.  The campaign included informational posters and emails, as well as asking students to wear bright orange shirts with slogans about the campaign to build visual awareness.  One aspect of the campaign was a postcard petition to encourage Harvard University Health Services to reduce the cost of the vaccine.  Campaign organizers also met with the Director of University Health Services, as well as the Director of Medicine to talk about subsidy options, resulting in UHS providing the vaccine free of charge.</p>

                                <p>On October 18th, 2006 The Seneca had the pleasure of co-sponsoring a nutrition event with Harvard's Eating Concerns Hotline and Outreach (ECHO).  Negotiating Nutrition brought in Harvard professionals to talk about nutrition in a college setting and strategies for making healthier decisions when faced with fast food and dining halls.  The goal of this event was to provide the student body with access to resources on campus (such as ECHO and Wellness Center nutritionists) that are often overlooked as well as to promote healthy approaches to nutrition and weight concerns</p>
